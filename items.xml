    Here are listed all the known items in The Mana World. This file defines
    their name, icon, description, weight, etc. It also defines which sprite
    to use in the case of visible equipment and which sounds to play on certain
    events related to the item.

    The 'weapon_type' attribute is kept for 0.0 client compatibility. Not to be
    confused with 'weapon-type'.
